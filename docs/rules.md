## webpack_binary

<pre>
webpack_binary(<a href="#webpack_binary-name">name</a>, <a href="#webpack_binary-node_modules">node_modules</a>)
</pre>

Create a webpack binary target from linked node_modules in the user's workspace.

Pass this into the `webpack` attribute of webpack_bundle to use your own linked
version of webpack rather than rules_webpack's version, which can help to avoid
certain errors caused by having two copies of webpack. The following three packages
must be linked into the node_modules virtual store target:

    webpack, webpack-cli, webpack-dev-server

</pre>

Runs the webpack devserver.

This is a macro that uses
[js_run_devserver](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/blob/main/docs/js_run_devserver.md)
under the hood.
