# Proves a few things about webpack_bundle's `supports-path-mapping` execution
# requirement (webpack/private/webpack_bundle.bzl):
#
# 1. It lets Bazel's path mapping share a single cached action between two
#    builds that differ only in compilation mode.
# 2. It is advertised in the ordinary case.
# 3. It is not advertised when doing so would be unsafe, i.e. when a location
#    expansion in `env` produced a real, non-path-mapped path.
#
# A shared --disk_cache is required: -c opt and -c fastbuild are different
# configurations, so each gets its own action instance the first time Bazel
# visits it in a given build graph -- the incremental "did anything change"
# check within one build never gets a chance to compare across them. Only an
# explicit disk (or remote) cache lookup, keyed by the path-mapped action
# digest, can serve the second build's action from the first build's result.
#
# BUILD.bazel sets use_execroot_entry_point = False on the `bundle` target:
# when True (the default), webpack_bundle hoists extra target-configuration
# inputs whose content bakes in the configuration-specific bindir path, which
# currently defeats cross-configuration cache sharing regardless of path
# mapping.
